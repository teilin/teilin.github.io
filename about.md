My name is Teis Lindemark. I am a [software developer](https://github.com/teilin) and a [beer home brewer](http://blog.bryggelaget.com). On this blog I am bloging about technologies I care about, home brewing, code and whatever I may be geeking around with. I just love to check out new stuff that's poping up in the technology world and gadget world.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can send me an email at [teis.lindemark@gmail.com](mailto:teis.lindemark@gmail.com).

#What have I been doing?
I have been studing computer engineering in a small town in the south of Norway, called Grimstad. Then I took tree month working at a [local university](http://www.out.ac.tz) in [Dar es Salaam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam) in Tanzania as a web developer. Then I moved to the second largest town in Norway, [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen) to study a master in informatics. After I finished my studies, I worked as a IT consultent at ElanIT/Experis IT for a year. Then I worked 3 years for as a software developer at Aktiv DataPartner AS. Currently I work at a company called Acos, as a software developer.
